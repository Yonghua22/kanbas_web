This article explains what CSS is with a simple syntax example and also covers some key terms about the language.In the Introduction to HTML module, we covered what HTML is and how it is used to mark up documents. These documents will be readable in a web browser. Headings will look larger than regular text, paragraphs break onto a new line and have space between them. Links are colored and underlined to distinguish them from the rest of the text. 
            What you are seeing are the browser's default styles — very basic styles — 
            that the browser applies to HTML to make sure that the page will be basically 
            readable even if no explicit styling is specified by the author of the page.
